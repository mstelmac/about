Hi there! My name is Marissa Stelmack and I am a graduate student at the University of Alberta, having just finished my first year of the dual Master in Digital Humanities and Master in Library and Information Studies. I am currently interested in the roles that institutional libraries can play in enacting reconciliation, decolonization, and reciprocity, such as the possibilities of inclusive classification systems and intangible cultural heritage preservation. I have previously completed an M.A. in English at the University of Calgary, during which time I specialized in Indigenous erotica and the sexualization of Indigenous bodies in romance fiction.

A Minifesto on Writing, Making, and Gaming ✒️

I have been a student in higher education for 6.5 years, and during the majority of that time, I held creativity and academia at a strict arms-length. This is in part due to the heirarchies and conventions of English departments, as they seek to distance creative writing from scholarly academic writing about creative works. For example, the first and second person voice is heavily frowned upon, as is any reference to personal experience or connection to the creative work you are writing about. As a result, I have been complicit in carrying around these pretentious attitudes and enforcing them through my work as a teaching assistant and editor, believing that I am not a *creative writer*, I am a **scholarly writer**, and for some reason there in an ~~important~~ hierarchical distinction between the two. 

And yet, I have recently been challenged in this thinking. Why is it that academia looks down on creators, unless they are writers of *literature* from the 19th century? How is it that I am so confident in my ability to write about and criticize literature and video games, and yet I have never tried to write or create anything of my own? This suddenly seemed like a huge, and frankly incredibly obvious, oversight to me. 

Therefore, I now see my work and research practice in a more holistic way - I cannot just write *about*, I must also write and create *my own* creative works. It has been a challenge to allow myself to share my thoughts, be vulnerable, and make things that are wholey unimpressive and may or may not even work. But by making and breaking games, being witty (or trying to, anyway), and writing from a personal perspective, I believe my positionality and voice become even stronger. There is strength in vulerability, and it's empowering to show this rather than hide behind my academic and impersonal opinions (which were formatted in MLA style, of course). So, even while I continue to pursue an academic career, my research practices will now include writing, making, and playing. Even if my games don't work, my code doesn't compile, and no one reads or plays my creations anyway, that's okay. Because I've still created things that I didn't think were possible before. 

Questions that Guide My Research Practices:
======
1. How can I reconcile my positionality as a settler-scholar and future librarian with my goals of furthering reconciliation and decolonization, given that academic and institutional libraries are inherently colonized spaces? 
2. How can I enact meaningful reciprocity and humility when engaging with works, themes, cultures, and stories which are not my own?
3. Is this a project that I can and should undertake, or is this work best done by someone else, such as a community member?
4. What is my purpose for undertaking this research, and what it is that I want to accomplish or spur with it?
